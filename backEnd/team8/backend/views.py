#to connect to front end:

"""In  GET method we are returning data from the model by calling React.objects.all() and then using list comprehension to
convert the author and their quotes in python’s dictionary. 
In the POST method, we are simply saving the data bypassing the data to ReactSerializer(). 
It’s time to define the endpoint of the API. The end-point of an API is the URL where our client will 
hit to consume data from the server. It is generally the place where our resources (database and other programmed functions) live."""
